\#**Problem 1**

\#\#create a data frame containing 4 variables

``` r
set.seed(1)

problem1_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(8),
  sample_logic = sample > 0,
  sample_char = c("hellow", "world", "this", "this", "is", "a","test", "!"),
  sample_factor = factor(c("apple", "banana", "grape", "banana", "grape",
                           "apple", "grape", "apple"))
)

mean(pull(problem1_df, sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.1314544

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, sample_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.625

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, sample_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, sample_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, sample_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, sample_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean value of variable sample and sample\_logic can be calculated
becuase the value stored in these 2 variables are numbers.

The mean value for variable sample\_logic and sample\_char cannot be
calculated because the value stored in these 2 variables are string.
